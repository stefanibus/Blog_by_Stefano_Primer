

STEP 1
    I developed the Inner-Blog first.
    Jquery for the NAV inside the blog 
    Blog template from CodePen, see Code-pen reference inside HTML  
    Added some styling, fixed some issues.  

STEP 2
    I used TailWindCSS Framework to build the skeleton (around the actual Blog)     
    I Played with TailWindCSS and learned about AlpineJS too 
    I have not fully understood the Alpine-JS Part 
    Neither the Tooling on CodeSandBox, 
    nor the tailwind.Config is understood. 
    UI-Template is: https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/page-examples/settings-screens

  
STEP 3 
    All my Attempts to Run any Build Process with PARCEL all failed completely
    I surrendered due to CodeSandBox Issues and PARCEL Build-Issues 
    Finally I simply complied my sass to css manually 
    Afterwards the result was ready to be published on Github Pages 
    
STEP 4 GITHUB PAGES 
    codeSandBox does not let me publish my files. 
    It wrongfully states: 
    Quote: "You have unsaved files".

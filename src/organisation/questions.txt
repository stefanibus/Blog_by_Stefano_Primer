	Issues with codesandbox are innumerable :   
        - page reload not rendering at all (page remanins white)
        - empty index.js File printing "undefinded" to the console 
        - open in new Window fails to render the HTML - too bad!
        - I am facing issues when using chrome inspector on codesandbox-Projects
        - WORST CASE!!!   Yesterdays data is LOST today = my changes seem to be lost!? What the heck! 
        - the HTML Preview Pane sometimes remains BLANK after I updated the index.html 	I am loosing a lot of time, waiting, often the preview never reders at all --> 
        - chrome inspector can almost not be used at all? because   opening the content in a new tab is almost impossible as the    page does not render -->
        - <!-- embed sass ?? THIS DID NOT WORK: HTML --> HEAD -->  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./src/innerBlog.scss" /> -->
        -  the console.log message will not get printed to the console (does work with  Settimeout)    //   console.log("boink boink");

        
<!-- in the HTML File 
  Why is the Script-tag:index.js placed  inside the Body TAG?

Import AlpineJS did work (inside nav.js)   
  Why do I see the below Error in the Cosole? 
  // 'alpinejs' is defined but never used (see nav.js)
  // import alpinejs from "alpinejs";

    endless number of attempts    
     <!--  FontAwesome: just cannot apply the Fontawesone-CSS-Rules successfully for unknown reasons 	-->

	  FontAwesome Libary: various  Issues  
    FONT AWESOME   
    // I have no idea how to import font-awesome info codesandBox propperly
    // import 'font-awesome/css/font-awesome.min.css';
    //  this finally did the trick: MAYBE NOT?!
    //   import "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/js/all.js"; 
    // import font-awesome from "font-awesome"; 
    // import font-awesome  ;


// is there a better was to import Google Fonts ?
// I am using a   Link-Tag in the Head STATICALLY ? 
 
 
 // what was this? 
//  import "style.scss"
//  import node-sass from './innerBlog.scss';


// To prevent the browser from printing "undefined" to the console: 
// I am using this workaround:
// console.log('');   
// The below console.log-message is intentionally empty
// IF a JS-File is completely without code --> 
// the console seems to  print an undefined message 
  
 
//  where and how does PARCEL take care of the Injection of the SCSS?  
//  import "style.scss";
